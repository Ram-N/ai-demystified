AI doesn’t replace creativity — it helps you grow it.

Many artists, students, and creators use GenAI to help them get started, get inspired, or try new things. It’s like having a friendly helper who never gets tired.

**Analogy**: AI is like a musical instrument — it sounds amazing, but only when a person plays it with skill and heart.

**Try this**: In groups, brainstorm a project (poster, poem, plan) that you could do better by using AI.
