# Is AI Always Fair? Spoiler: Not Really

AI might look neutral, but it can carry the same biases as the people and data that trained it.

## Focus
- Understanding fairness and bias in AI
- How bias creeps in through data and design

## Analogy
Like teaching a robot only from one perspective — it will reflect those views.

## Interactive Activity
Show students AI-generated outputs (e.g., about job applicants) and ask, “Is this fair? Why or why not?”
