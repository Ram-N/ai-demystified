# AI Can’t Explain Itself — Should That Worry Us?

Many AI systems are “black boxes.” We don’t always know how they make decisions — and that can be a problem.

## Focus
- Transparency and explainability in AI systems
- Why it matters when decisions affect people

## Analogy
Like a magic vending machine that gives answers — but won’t tell you how it works.

## Interactive Activity
Run a “black box” guessing game: students guess the logic behind a secret sorting rule, then reveal the rule.
