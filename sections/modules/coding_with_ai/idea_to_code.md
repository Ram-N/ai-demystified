# From Idea to Code: Turning Concepts into Commands

Describe what you want to build — and let AI help you turn those ideas into working code.

## Focus
- Prompting with clarity to turn goals into code
- Structuring your ideas in steps

## Analogy
Like giving a chef a clear recipe idea — the more detail, the better the result.

## Interactive Activity
Describe a small app idea (e.g., tip calculator), then prompt AI to generate the code. Review what works and refine prompts.
