# What’s a Model? It’s Like a Formula With Opinions

An AI model is like a recipe that adjusts over time based on what’s working — it makes predictions using what it has learned.

## Focus
- Basic definition of an ML model
- How data changes the model's behavior

## Analogy
Like a cake recipe that improves every time you bake it, based on feedback.

## Interactive Activity
Have students use data (like height and shoe size) to build a basic rule and adjust it to improve accuracy.
