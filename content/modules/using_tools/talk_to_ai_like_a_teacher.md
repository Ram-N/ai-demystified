# Talk to AI Like a Teacher, Not a Search Engine

Many people type vague questions into AI tools and get frustrated. But AI works best when your prompts are thoughtful and specific.

## Focus
- Writing clear, structured prompts
- Avoiding vague or confusing questions

## Analogy
Like giving instructions to a robot — specific and step-by-step works best.

## Interactive Activity
Rephrase vague prompts into clearer ones. Example: change “Tell me about India” to “Give me 3 bullet points on the geography of India.”
