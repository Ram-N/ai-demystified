# Level Up: Improve, Extend, or Refactor Your Code with AI

AI can help you go beyond working code â€” making it faster, cleaner, and easier to understand.

## Focus
- Using AI for code improvements and optimization
- Prompting for refactoring or adding features

## Analogy
Like handing your sketch to an architect to help you design something better.

## Interactive Activity
Give students a working but messy script, then use AI to refactor it. Compare and discuss the improvements.
