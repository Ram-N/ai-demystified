# Your AI Coding Buddy: Asking the Right Questions

Learn how to treat AI like a tutor: ask it to explain errors, walk through concepts, and even teach you step-by-step.

## Focus
- Using AI to get help with coding concepts and syntax
- Asking effective coding questions

## Analogy
Like having a patient coding teacher sitting beside you, 24/7.

## Interactive Activity
Start with a buggy piece of code and a vague prompt like “Fix this.” Then rewrite the prompt more clearly and compare the AI’s responses.
