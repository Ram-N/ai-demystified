# Learning from Examples: How AI Gets "Smarter" Over Time

AI improves through training â€” by looking at labeled examples and learning patterns from them.

## Focus
- Supervised learning using labeled data
- Concept of feedback and iteration

## Analogy
Like a student learning from worked-out answers in a math textbook.

## Interactive Activity
Give students mock training data (e.g., photos of animals with labels) and let them build their own "rule." Then test on new data.
