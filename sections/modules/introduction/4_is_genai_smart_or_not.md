Generative AI looks smart — but is it really?

Not exactly. It doesn’t “understand” things the way humans do. It looks at patterns from huge amounts of text, images, or music and makes predictions about what comes next.

**Analogy**: Like a super parrot that’s memorized the entire internet — but doesn’t actually understand feelings or ideas.

**Try this**: Ask an AI questions like: “How are you feeling today?” or “Can you love someone?” Notice how it responds.
