# Why ChatGPT Doesn’t Really ‘Understand’ You

LLMs are great at *generating* language, but they don’t understand context, intent, or emotion like humans do.

## Focus
- The gap between pattern-matching and comprehension
- Why AI can sound smart without actually “knowing” anything
- Limitations of machine-generated responses

## Analogy
A parrot can say “I love you,” but it doesn’t know what love is.

## Interactive Idea
Give students intentionally confusing prompts and compare their interpretations to the AI’s response.
