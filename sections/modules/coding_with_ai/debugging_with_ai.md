# Debugging with AI: Fixing What’s Broken (or Missing)

AI is great at spotting bugs and suggesting fixes — if you know how to ask it the right way.

## Focus
- Using AI to help with code debugging
- Interpreting AI's feedback and suggestions

## Analogy
Like calling in a second pair of eyes to help clean your messy room — they'll notice what you missed.

## Interactive Activity
Students write a buggy function, then prompt AI to fix it. Compare how well AI spots and explains the error.
