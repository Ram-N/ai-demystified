# Guessing the Next Word: The Math Behind AI Magic

AI makes predictions using probability — just like we do when playing word games or guessing lyrics.

## Focus
- How AI predicts next words using patterns and probability
- Basic idea of ranking multiple possible outputs

## Analogy
Like playing a fill-in-the-blank game — you guess based on what makes the most sense.

## Interactive Activity
Give students partial sentences and multiple-choice next words. Let them vote, then show how AI would "score" each option.
