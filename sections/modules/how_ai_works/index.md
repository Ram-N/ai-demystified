# Articles in This Module: How Does AI Work?

The topics in this foundational module bridge intuition and early technical understanding. Below are five article-style topics tailored for students aged 12–18. Each one aims to simplify core concepts behind how AI works — with stats, machine learning, and logic — using analogies and hands-on activities to build understanding.

- [Guessing the Next Word: The Math Behind AI Magic](next_word_prediction.html)  
  How AI predicts what word comes next using patterns and probability.

- [Learning from Examples: How AI Gets 'Smarter' Over Time](learning_from_data.html)  
  Discover how AI uses examples and labels to improve with practice.

- [Patterns Everywhere: Why AI Loves Finding Repeats](pattern_recognition.html)  
  Learn how detecting patterns helps AI make predictions and sort data.

- [What’s a Model? It’s Like a Formula With Opinions](what_is_a_model.html)  
  Explore how a “model” in AI is built and refined over time.

- [AI Doesn’t Think — It Calculates (Fast)](ai_vs_human_thinking.html)  
  Understand the difference between human thought and machine computation.
