# Tokens, Prompts, and Predictions: The Language of LLMs

LLMs break your sentence into chunks called *tokens* and use your prompt to predict what should come next.

## Focus
- What are tokens?
- How does a prompt guide the AI’s output?
- How prediction probability works

## Analogy
Writing a prompt is like tossing a ball — the way you throw it changes where it lands.

## Interactive Idea
Challenge students to rewrite a prompt in 3 different ways and observe how the AI output changes.
