# Who’s Responsible When AI Gets It Wrong?

When AI makes a mistake, who should take the blame — the coder, the company, or the machine?

## Focus
- Accountability in AI use and deployment
- Legal, ethical, and social perspectives

## Analogy
Like a self-driving car crash — who’s responsible: the driver, the car, or the builder?

## Interactive Activity
Debate scenarios where AI fails. Who should be held responsible, and why?
