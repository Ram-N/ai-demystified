## Should you bother to learn this material?

I created this content for the **"AI-Curious" Beginner** which is anyone feeling a bit overwhelmed by the AI hype and wanting a clear, friendly, and practical introduction to using AI tools effectively in everyday creative and learning tasks.

I am writing for curious minds of all ages -- which is anyone who keeps hearing about AI on the news, in conversations, or online, and wants to genuinely understand what it is, what it isn't, and why it's such a big deal, without getting lost in overly technical jargon.

#### Students
If you are a student, you are already using LLMs and generative AI in your day-to-day life. It is all around us. What can we do with it beyond using it for homework, and creating some fun art? And how on earth is it so good at what it does? My hope is that these "lessons" will also help you understand future career paths in a world shaped by AI.

**Parents & Educators:** I am targeting this at adults who want to stay informed about the technologies impacting young people's lives, understand how AI tools work, and engage in informed discussions about AI's role in education and the future.


## Not Lessons But Quizzes and Glossary

If you'd rather NOT bother reading these "lessons", then you could still derive value.
1. Try some of the [instant quizzes](../quizzes). See how well you know this material. If something is not clear, go to that lesson.
2. [The Glossary](../glossary). This world of AI is full of new terms and phrases, and just click around and see if anything catches your eye.
