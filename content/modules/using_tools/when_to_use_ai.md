# When to Use AI — and When Not To

AI is a powerful helper, but it’s not always the best choice. Know when to rely on it — and when to think for yourself.

## Focus
- AI strengths (summarizing, formatting, brainstorming)
- AI limits (opinions, personal experiences, deep understanding)

## Analogy
Like a calculator: good for quick results, but not for learning the steps.

## Interactive Activity
Sort example tasks into three categories: “Good for AI,” “Better for Humans,” “Both Together.”
