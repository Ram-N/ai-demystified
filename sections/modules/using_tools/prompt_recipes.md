# Prompt Recipes: How to Get the AI to Do What You Want

Prompts can follow patterns — like recipes — to produce better results. Use formats like “List,” “Compare,” “Summarize,” or “Explain like I’m 12.”

## Focus
- Using structured prompt formats
- Understanding how structure shapes responses

## Analogy
A recipe tells you how to make a dish — a well-structured prompt helps the AI make what you need.

## Interactive Activity
Prompt challenge: students get different prompt types and compare their outputs.
