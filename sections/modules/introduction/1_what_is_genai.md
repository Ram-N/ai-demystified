What is Generative AI, and how is it different from the other AI we may have heard about?

Imagine you have a friend who’s really good at looking up facts (that’s like traditional AI). But now, you meet someone who can make things — stories, pictures, songs — just from your ideas. That’s Generative AI.

Unlike older AIs that were mostly about rules or finding the right answer, GenAI creates something new. It can write a story, draw a picture, or even suggest code.

**Analogy**: Regular AI is like a librarian who finds you the right book. Generative AI is like an author who writes you a brand-new story.

**Try this**: Use Google to search “What is a black hole?” Then ask ChatGPT the same thing. How do the answers feel different?
