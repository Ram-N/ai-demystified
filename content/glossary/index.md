# Glossary: Understanding Generative AI

Here are some common words and phrases you'll hear when learning about Generative AI, with simple explanations to help you understand them. Click on any term to learn more!

---

# A - F

**[Algorithm](./algorithm.html)**
A set of step-by-step instructions or rules that a computer follows to complete a task, like a recipe for a computer.

**[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](./artificial-intelligence.html)**
Making computers do smart things that usually need human brains, like learning, solving problems, or making decisions.

**[Bias (in AI)](./ai-bias.html)**
When an AI system gives unfair or incorrect answers because the information it learned from wasn't complete or was tilted in one direction. This can lead to unfair results.

**[Chatbot](./chatbot.html)**
A computer program designed to have conversations with people, usually by typing or talking. Many chatbots use Generative AI to create their responses.

**[Data](./data.html)**
Information that computers use to learn and make decisions. This can be text, pictures, numbers, sounds, or anything else a computer can process.

**[Deep Learning](./deep-learning.html)**
A type of machine learning that uses very complex systems (called neural networks with many layers) to learn from huge amounts of data. It's how AI can learn to do really complicated things, like recognize faces or understand different languages.

**[Ethics (in AI)](./ai-ethics.html)**
Thinking about what's right and wrong when we build and use AI. It's about making sure AI is used safely, fairly, and helpfully for everyone.

# G - L

**[Generative AI](./generative-ai.html)**
A type of artificial intelligence that can create brand new things that didn't exist before, like writing a story, drawing a picture, composing music, or creating a video, based on what it has learned.

**[Hallucination (AI)](./ai-hallucination.html)**
When an AI model confidently states something that isn't true or isn't based on the data it learned from. It's like the AI is "making things up."

**[Image Generation](./image-generation.html)**
A type of Generative AI that creates new pictures or artwork from text descriptions (prompts) or by changing existing images.

**[Input](./input.html)**
The information or instructions you give to an AI system. For example, when you type a question into a chatbot, your question is the input.

**[Large Language Model (LLM)](./large-language-model.html)**
A very powerful AI that has been trained on a massive amount of text and code. LLMs can understand and generate human-like text, answer questions, translate languages, and much more.

# M - R

**[Machine Learning (ML)](./machine-learning.html)**
A way for computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every single step. The computer finds patterns in the data and uses those patterns to make predictions or decisions.

**[Model (AI Model)](./ai-model.html)**
The "brain" of an AI system. It's the part that has learned from data and can then be used to make predictions, generate content, or perform a specific task.

**[Natural Language Processing (NLP)](./natural-language-processing.html)**
A field of AI that focuses on helping computers understand, interpret, and generate human language, both written and spoken.

**[Neural Network](./neural-network.html)**
A computer system inspired by the way human brains work, with many connected "nodes" or "neurons" that process information together. They are good at finding patterns and learning complex things.

# O-S

**[Output (or Generation)](./ai-output.html)**
The new content (like text, an image, code, or sound) that a Generative AI creates after it receives an input or prompt.

**[Prompt](./prompt.html)**
The instruction, question, or piece of text you give to a Generative AI to tell it what you want it to create or do.

**[Prompt Engineering](./prompt-engineering.html)**
The skill of carefully crafting good prompts to get the best, most accurate, or most creative results from a Generative AI model.

# T-Z

**[Token](./token.html)**
In Large Language Models, text is broken down into smaller pieces called tokens. A token can be a whole word, part of a word, or even a punctuation mark. AI models "think" in terms of tokens.

**[Training (AI Training)](./ai-training.html)**
The process of "teaching" an AI model by feeding it lots of data. During training, the model learns to find patterns, make connections, and understand how to perform its task.
