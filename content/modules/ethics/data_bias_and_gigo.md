# Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why Data Matters

AI learns from data — but if the data is incomplete or biased, the results will be too.

## Focus
- Importance of high-quality, balanced data
- The concept of GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out)

## Analogy
Like studying from a one-sided or outdated textbook — your answers won't reflect the full picture.

## Interactive Activity
Label and analyze sample datasets (e.g., name lists or images) for balance or bias.
