# How Does an LLM Actually Work?

LLMs like ChatGPT work by predicting the next word in a sentence based on patterns they've learned from reading large amounts of text.

## Focus
- Tokens and next-word prediction
- Pattern recognition over vast datasets
- Probability-based decision-making

## Analogy
Like guessing the next lyric in a song you know really well — the AI isn’t “thinking,” it’s matching patterns.

## Interactive Idea
Let students write a sentence and ask the class to guess the next word, simulating how an LLM operates.
