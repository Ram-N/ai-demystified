# AI Doesn’t Think — It Calculates (Fast)

AI doesn’t “understand” — it just calculates and ranks answers really, really fast.

## Focus
- Human thinking vs machine pattern recognition
- The role of logic and math vs intuition and emotion

## Analogy
Like a calculator solving math problems — fast and accurate, but not conscious.

## Interactive Activity
Ask students to compare how they’d solve a logic puzzle vs how a machine would do it. Then simulate both.
