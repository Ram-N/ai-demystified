# Can AI Tell the Truth? The Problem with Deepfakes and Misinformation

AI can generate content so realistic, it’s hard to tell what’s real — and that can be dangerous.

## Focus
- Deepfakes, misinformation, and AI-generated deception
- How to spot false content and why it matters

## Analogy
Like a photoshopped image that looks real — except it talks.

## Interactive Activity
Show real vs AI-generated examples and ask students to guess which is which. Discuss how they decided.
