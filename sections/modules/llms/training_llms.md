# Training an AI: Reading the Internet at Super Speed

Training an LLM means feeding it millions of text examples so it can learn how language works — but it reads without truly understanding.

## Focus
- What it means to "train" an AI
- Pattern spotting across large datasets
- The role of training data in shaping outputs

## Analogy
Imagine a student who speed-reads every book in the library and remembers patterns, but not meaning.

## Interactive Idea
Show students “before and after” examples of training data and have them guess what patterns the AI might learn.
