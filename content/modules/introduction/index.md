# Introduction to Generative AI

What is Generative AI, and why has it suddenly become a topic of global conversation? This initial module sets the stage by defining Generative AI, distinguishing it from other types of artificial intelligence, and highlighting its significance in today’s technological world. We’ll touch upon the diverse applications of these tools and explore the exciting possibilities they unlock, preparing you for a deeper dive into how they actually work.

The topics in this module are presented as blog-style lessons designed for students aged 12–18. Each one is structured with a clear focus, a relatable analogy, and an interactive activity.

## Lessons

### [L1. What Is Generative AI?](1_what_is_genai.html)
- **Focus**: Define Generative AI and contrast it with traditional AI.
- **Analogy**: Regular AI is like a librarian who finds you the right book. Generative AI is like an author who writes you a brand-new story.
- **Activity**: Students try two tools: a search engine vs. a text generator (e.g. Google vs. ChatGPT), then compare what each one does.

### [L3. What Can It Create?](3_what_can_genai_create.html)
- **Focus**: Showcase the outputs—text, images, music, video, and code.
- **Analogy**: It’s like a super creative assistant who never gets tired and works in any art form you ask.
- **Activity**: Rotate through AI demos, then present a “Top 3 coolest AI things I saw.”


### [L4. Humans + AI: Better Together?](5_humans_plus_ai.html)
- **Focus**: Emphasize collaboration—how people use AI to enhance creativity, not replace it.
- **Analogy**: AI is like a musical instrument—you still need a person to play it beautifully.
- **Activity**: In groups, students brainstorm a creative project they could make better with AI help.
