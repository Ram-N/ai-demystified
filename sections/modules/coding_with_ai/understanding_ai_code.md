# Reading AI Code: Don’t Just Copy, Understand

AI can write code for you, but you’ll learn more if you take time to understand what it gave you.

## Focus
- Reading and analyzing AI-generated code
- Building confidence by annotating and testing

## Analogy
Like using GPS — follow it, but also understand the route so you’re not lost without it.

## Interactive Activity
Give students a block of AI code and ask them to comment each line with explanations.
